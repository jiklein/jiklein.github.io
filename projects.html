Teach people about the effects of climate change and what they can do to help 
though an interactive game that is both educational and entertaining. Players
must place falling trash items into the proper bin before they hit the ground.
<br><br>
I interfaced with the java swing library and used event driven concepts to
create the user experience as well as multithreading to animate the falling 
trash items (each item runs on a separate thread).
<br><br>
This project was for my writing class where we were required to create a multimodal 
project that inspired people about climate change. While many students chose to
make a simple poster or PowerPoint, I decided to make an entire video game!<br>

Are you tired of wasting too much time on the popular app <a target="_blank"
  href="https://apps.apple.com/cg/app/wordscapes/id1207472156">Wordscapes</a>?
I found that I was. Well, look no further! This program allows you to pass
through multiple levels with ease.
<br><br>
Simply enter in the letters presented to you on a given level and
WordDestroyer! will print all of the possible words that can be formed,
using a dictionary of your choice (default is <a target="_blank"

<p>
This was my very first coding project! 
<br><br>
Be warned. It is not very well commented or organized, but theoretically allows
the user to win at Clue. </p>
